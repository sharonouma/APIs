RESTful APIs README


Introduction
This README file explains the usage of serializers and function-based views in our RESTful APIs. Our RESTful APIs are designed for a book management system and follow the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

Serializers
Serializers in our RESTful APIs are used to convert complex data types (such as querysets and model instances) into native Python data types that can then be easily rendered into JSON, XML, or other content types. They also handle deserialization, allowing parsed data to be converted back into complex types after validation.

Usage
Create a Serializer Class: Define a serializer class that inherits from serializers.ModelSerializer and specify the model and fields you want to include.
Use the Serializer in Views: Instantiate the serializer class with the queryset or model instance you want to serialize, and then access the serialized data using serializer.data.
Function Based Views
Function-based views are simple views based on Python functions. These views take a request and return a response.

Usage
Create a Function Based View: Define a function that takes a request object and returns a response object. You can use the @api_view decorator to specify the HTTP methods allowed for the view.
URL Configuration: Map the function-based view to a URL pattern in your urls.py file.
CRUD Operations
Our APIs support the following CRUD operations:

Create: Allows the creation of new book entries.
Read: Retrieves book entries from the database.
Update: Allows updating existing book entries.
Delete: Allows the deletion of book entries from the database.
